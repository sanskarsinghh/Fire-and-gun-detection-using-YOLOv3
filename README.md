Fire and Gun Detection using Machine Learning ðŸš’ðŸ”«

Overview :

The Fire and Gun Detection project aims to enhance public safety by leveraging machine learning techniques to develop a real-time surveillance system capable of detecting fire incidents and firearms. This system utilizes advanced image and video processing algorithms to identify potentially dangerous situations, providing early warnings and enabling rapid response to prevent loss of life and property.
Features

    ðŸ”¥ Fire Detection: Identifies fire incidents in real-time using advanced image processing.
    ðŸ”« Gun Detection: Detects firearms in surveillance footage to alert authorities quickly.
    ðŸš¨ Early Warning System: Provides immediate alerts for quick response and mitigation.
    ðŸ“¹ Real-time Surveillance: Continuous monitoring through real-time video feeds.
